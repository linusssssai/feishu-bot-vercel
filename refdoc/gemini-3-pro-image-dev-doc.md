Image generation with Gemini (aka Nano Banana & Nano Banana Pro)

content_copy



Gemini can generate and process images conversationally. You can prompt either the fast Gemini 2.5 Flash (aka Nano Banana) or the advanced Gemini 3 Pro Preview (aka Nano Banana Pro) image models with text, images, or a combination of both, allowing you to create, edit, and iterate on visuals with unprecedented control:

Text, Image, and Multi-Image to Image: Generate high-quality images from text descriptions, use text prompts to edit and adjust a given image, or use multiple input images to compose new scenes and transfer styles.
Iterative refinement: Conversationally refine your image over multiple turns, making small adjustments until it's perfect.
High-Fidelity text rendering: Accurately generate images that contain legible and well-placed text, ideal for logos, diagrams, and posters.
All generated images include a SynthID watermark.

New with Gemini 3 Pro Image
Gemini 3 Pro Image (gemini-3-pro-image-preview) is a state-of-the-art image generation and editing model optimized for professional asset production. Designed to tackle the most challenging workflows through advanced reasoning, it excels at complex, multi-turn creation and modification tasks.

High-resolution output: Built-in generation capabilities for 1K, 2K, and 4K visuals.
Advanced text rendering: Capable of generating legible, stylized text for infographics, menus, diagrams, and marketing assets.
Grounding with Google Search: The model can use Google Search as a tool to verify facts and generate imagery based on real-time data (e.g., current weather maps, stock charts, recent events).
Thinking mode: The model utilizes a "thinking" process to reason through complex prompts. It generates interim "thought images" (visible in the backend but not charged) to refine the composition before producing the final high-quality output.
Up to 14 reference images: You can now mix up to 14 reference images to produce the final image.
Use up to 14 reference images
Gemini 3 Pro Preview lets you to mix up to 14 reference images. These 14 images can include the following:

Up to 6 images of objects with high-fidelity to include in the final image
Up to 5 images of humans to maintain character consistency

The response includes groundingMetadata which contains the following required fields:

searchEntryPoint: Contains the HTML and CSS to render the required search suggestions.
groundingChunks: Returns the top 3 web sources used to ground the generated image
Generate images up to 4K resolution
Gemini 3 Pro Image generates 1K images by default but can also output 2K and 4K images. To generate higher resolution assets, specify the image_size in the generation_config.

You must use an uppercase 'K' (e.g., 1K, 2K, 4K). Lowercase parameters (e.g., 1k) will be rejected.

Thinking Process
The Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview model is a thinking model and uses a reasoning process ("Thinking") for complex prompts. This feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled in the API. To learn more about the thinking process, see the Gemini Thinking guide.

The model generates up to two interim images to test composition and logic. The last image within Thinking is also the final rendered image.

You can check the thoughts that lead to the final image being produced.

Python
Javascript

for part in response.parts:
    if part.thought:
        if part.text:
            print(part.text)
        elif image:= part.as_image():
            image.show()
Thought Signatures
Thought signatures are encrypted representations of the model's internal thought process and are used to preserve reasoning context across multi-turn interactions. All responses include a thought_signature field. As a general rule, if you receive a thought signature in a model response, you should pass it back exactly as received when sending the conversation history in the next turn. Failure to circulate thought signatures may cause the response to fail. Check the thought signature documentation for more explanations of signatures overall.

Note: If you use the official Google Gen AI SDKs and use the chat feature (or append the full model response object directly to history), thought signatures are handled automatically. You do not need to manually extract or manage them, or change your code.
Here is how thought signatures work:

All inline_data parts with image mimetype which are part of the response should have signature.
If there are some text parts at the beginning (before any image) right after the thoughts, the first text part should also have a signature.
Thoughts do not have signatures; If inline_data parts with image mimetype are part of thoughts, they will not have signatures.
The following code shows an example of where thought signatures are included:


[
  {
    "inline_data": {
      "data": "<base64_image_data_0>",
      "mime_type": "image/png"
    },
    "thought": true // Thoughts don't have signatures
  },
  {
    "inline_data": {
      "data": "<base64_image_data_1>",

Other image generation modes
Gemini supports other image interaction modes based on prompt structure and context, including:

Text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Outputs images with related text.
Example prompt: "Generate an illustrated recipe for a paella."
Image(s) and text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Uses input images and text to create new related images and text.
Example prompt: (With an image of a furnished room) "What other color sofas would work in my space? can you update the image?"
Generate images in batch
If you need to generate a lot of images, you can use the Batch API. You get higher rate limits in exchange for a turnaround of up to 24 hours.

Check the Batch API image generation documentation and the cookbook for Batch API image examples and code.

Prompting guide and strategies
Mastering image generation starts with one fundamental principle:

Describe the scene, don't just list keywords. The model's core strength is its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image than a list of disconnected words.

Prompts for generating images
The following strategies will help you create effective prompts to generate exactly the images you're looking for.

1. Photorealistic scenes
For realistic images, use photography terms. Mention camera angles, lens types, lighting, and fine details to guide the model toward a photorealistic result.

Best Practices
To elevate your results from good to great, incorporate these professional strategies into your workflow.

Be Hyper-Specific: The more detail you provide, the more control you have. Instead of "fantasy armor," describe it: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
Provide Context and Intent: Explain the purpose of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence the final output. For example, "Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand" will yield better results than just "Create a logo."
Iterate and Refine: Don't expect a perfect image on the first try. Use the conversational nature of the model to make small changes. Follow up with prompts like, "That's great, but can you make the lighting a bit warmer?" or "Keep everything the same, but change the character's expression to be more serious."
Use Step-by-Step Instructions: For complex scenes with many elements, break your prompt into steps. "First, create a background of a serene, misty forest at dawn. Then, in the foreground, add a moss-covered ancient stone altar. Finally, place a single, glowing sword on top of the altar."
Use "Semantic Negative Prompts": Instead of saying "no cars," describe the desired scene positively: "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."
Control the Camera: Use photographic and cinematic language to control the composition. Terms like wide-angle shot, macro shot, low-angle perspective.
Limitations
For best performance, use the following languages: EN, ar-EG, de-DE, es-MX, fr-FR, hi-IN, id-ID, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pt-BR, ru-RU, ua-UA, vi-VN, zh-CN.
Image generation does not support audio or video inputs.
The model won't always follow the exact number of image outputs that the user explicitly asks for.
gemini-2.5-flash-image works best with up to 3 images as input, while gemini-3-pro-image-preview supports 5 images with high fidelity, and up to 14 images in total.
When generating text for an image, Gemini works best if you first generate the text and then ask for an image with the text.
All generated images include a SynthID watermark.
Optional configurations
You can optionally configure the response modalities and aspect ratio of the model's output in the config field of generate_content calls.

Output types
The model defaults to returning text and image responses (i.e. response_modalities=['Text', 'Image']). You can configure the response to return only images without text using response_modalities=['Image'].

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
    contents=[prompt],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_modalities=['Image']
    )
)
Aspect ratios and image size
The model defaults to matching the output image size to that of your input image, or otherwise generates 1:1 squares. You can control the aspect ratio of the output image using the aspect_ratio field under image_config in the response request, shown here:

Python
JavaScript
Go
Java
REST

# For gemini-2.5-flash-image
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash-image",
    contents=[prompt],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        image_config=types.ImageConfig(
            aspect_ratio="16:9",
        )
    )
)

# For gemini-3-pro-image-preview
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    contents=[prompt],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        image_config=types.ImageConfig(
            aspect_ratio="16:9",
            image_size="2K",
        )
    )
)
The different ratios available and the size of the image generated are listed in the following tables:
